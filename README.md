<h1> Urgent Freight Management</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The project involved the development of a data entry tool to effectively manage urgent freight requests. The tool was designed to capture and track freight request data accurately, providing real-time visibility into urgent stock requirements. Integrated with a Power BI report, it enabled the interpretation of request patterns, delivering insights to improve stock planning and freight logistics. The system was structured to support data-driven decision-making and is adaptable as a standardized solution across all FQM sites.

The image below provides an overview of the key data categories captured during the processing of urgent freight requests, including associated financial currency conversions. These categories include Requester Details, Logistics Information, and Freight Quotations. To support the adjudication and selection of a freight forwarder, a minimum of three quotations are recorded as part of the process. <br/>

The image below highlights the data captured by the requester, including fields such as Stock Code, Reason for Urgency, and Preferred Freight Method. Collecting this information enables trend analysisâ€”for instance, identifying stock items frequently requested on an urgent basis, which may indicate the need to review and adjust stock minimum and maximum levels. Additionally, analyzing common reasons for urgent freight requests supports the development of corrective action plans aimed at improving planning and minimizing emergency shipments. <br/>
