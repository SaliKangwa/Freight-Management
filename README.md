<h1> Urgent Freight Management</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved developing a data entry tool and a Power BI report to manage urgent freight requests for Kansanshi. The tool was designed to capture and track freight request data efficiently, ensuring accurate and real-time visibility into urgent stock needs. The Power BI report provided insights into request patterns, helping to improve stock planning and freight logistics. The system was structured to support data-driven decision-making and could be adapted as a standardized solution for all FQM sites.
