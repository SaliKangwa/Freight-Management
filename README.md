<h1> Urgent Freight Management</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved developing a data entry tool to help manage urgent freight requests. The tool was designed to capture and track freight request data efficiently, ensuring accurate and real-time visibility into urgent stock needs. This is a data entry tool to interpret data in a Power BI report provided insights into request patterns, helping to improve stock planning and freight logistics. The system was structured to support data-driven decision-making and could be adapted as a standardized solution for all FQM sites.

This image highlights the data captured by the requester, including fields such as Stock Code, Reason for Urgency, and Preferred Freight Method. Capturing this information supports trend analysis â€” for example, identifying stock items that are frequently requested urgently, which may indicate a need to review and adjust stock Minimum and Maximum Levels. It also helps to analyze common reasons for urgent freight requests, supporting the development of corrective action plans to improve planning and reduce emergency shipments. <br/>
